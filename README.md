# ZenGardenCSS
[CssZenGarden website](http://www.csszengarden.com/) invites CSS enthusiasts for a challenge.
An existing HTML code is provided at the CssZenGarden.com. This code is not to be changed. One can only add their CSS code to manipulate the existing HTML to a desired theme or design. My theme was to make the HTML structure look like a mobile Windows 10 screen. This includes mimicking the metro tiles, the animations of the tiles, the sidebar with its buttons, and the taskbar with the start button. The objective was get as close as itâ€™s technically possible to the look, feel, and the functionality of the Microsoft tablet screen.
Here are some screenshots of the final product:
